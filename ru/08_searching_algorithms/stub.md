- Linear search
- Binary search (possible variations like exponential or fibonacci search)
- Binary search tree (note on allocators, aka if you construct it, use it a bunch, then you don't need it, use an arena, or just allocate nodes and use indices instead of pointers)
- Complexity analysis (should complexity be a separate chapter? I mean, I think it's pretty simple)

For the C++ OOP part (I think I need to teach this to the 2nd year students):
- Accessibility modifiers
- The concept and motivation of a vtable (polymorphism, virtual methods)
- Linear search of implemented vtable vs adjusting the pointer
- Interfaces (abstract classes without fields) for polymorphism
- Single inheritance of fields (no pointer adjustment)
- Virtual inheritance (pointer adjustment)
- Useless diamond inheritance, how solved at a low level (see link in resources), syntax
- `std::static_cast`, `std::dynamic_cast`, `std::reinterpret_cast`

- More on C arrays, why they suck
- Static array and `std::array`
- `std::span`
- `char[x]` vs `const char*` vs `std::string_view`
- Dynamic arrays (custom implementation), with and without resizing
- Basic templates

For more advanced students:
- foreach syntax
- iterators?
- Ownership of memory, `std::span`
- `std::string`
